# 92 — Speaker Grille Pattern

This folder contains a **working example** that generates a STEP model for: Procedural grille patterns (hex, waves) with thickness and acoustic openness controls.

The intent is that you can run the code here to emit a STEP file, open it in a CAD viewer, and/or import it into your slicer to 3D print and iterate.

## What this example demonstrates
- procedural patterns
- aesthetic + functional parameters
- assembly-friendly interfaces
- parametric dimensions as first-class inputs

## Parameters to try
- `patternScale`
- `thickness`
- `openness`
- `filletRadius`
- `chamferSize`

## Suggested extensions
- add snap-fit mounting rings
- generate multiple pattern families automatically
- add a variant generator (small/medium/large)
