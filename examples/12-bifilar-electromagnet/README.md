# 012-bifilar-electromagnet

Here's a video describing the process of how I came up with this model:

[![Axial plus Radial Bifilar Electromagnet](https://img.youtube.com/vi/CV303dJUbq0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV303dJUbq0)

If the coils are wound such that the first and second coils share the same
radius but are wound next to each other (180-degrees out of phase), and then
the next pair of windings is completely rotated 180 degrees, then the
capacitance between the coils will be in both the radial direction _and_ the
axial direction!
