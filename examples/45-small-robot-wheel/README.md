# 45 — Small Robot Wheel

This folder contains a **working example** that generates a STEP model for: A wheel with parametric tread, hub geometry, and bearing/axle options.

The intent is that you can run the code here to emit a STEP file, open it in a CAD viewer, and/or import it into your slicer to 3D print and iterate.

## What this example demonstrates
- precision seats/pockets
- repeatable fits for standard parts
- parameter sweeps for real-world tuning
- mount geometry derived from standards

## Parameters to try
- `seatDiameter`
- `seatDepth`
- `clearance`
- `holeSpacing`
- `mountThickness`

## Suggested extensions
- add retention clips or covers
- add test coupons for your printer/material
- add cable routing features
