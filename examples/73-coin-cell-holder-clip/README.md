# 73 — Coin Cell Holder Clip

This folder contains a **working example** that generates a STEP model for: A clip-style coin cell holder demonstrating thin flex features.

The intent is that you can run the code here to emit a STEP file, open it in a CAD viewer, and/or import it into your slicer to 3D print and iterate.

## What this example demonstrates
- spring features by construction
- print-friendly flexure geometry
- clearance tuning for reliable snaps
- arraying features from data

## Parameters to try
- `snapClearance`
- `armThickness`
- `filletRadius`
- `rows`
- `cols`

## Suggested extensions
- generate a “fit ladder” variant automatically
- add chamfers to improve assembly feel
- generate multiple sizes in one run
