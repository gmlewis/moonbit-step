# 65 — Stencil Text Generator

This folder contains a **working example** that generates a STEP model for: A stencil generator that automatically inserts bridges for “floating” letters.

The intent is that you can run the code here to emit a STEP file, open it in a CAD viewer, and/or import it into your slicer to 3D print and iterate.

## What this example demonstrates
- programmatic text/layout
- consistent engraving/emboss depths
- parametric borders and spacing
- arraying features from data

## Parameters to try
- `text`
- `fontSize`
- `embossDepth`
- `rows`
- `cols`

## Suggested extensions
- add a second font/style variant
- add alignment marks or registration features
- generate multiple sizes in one run
