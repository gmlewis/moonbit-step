# 57 — Water Bottle Cage

This folder contains a **working example** that generates a STEP model for: A cage built from arcs/splines and thickness constraints, sized to your bottle.

The intent is that you can run the code here to emit a STEP file, open it in a CAD viewer, and/or import it into your slicer to 3D print and iterate.

## What this example demonstrates
- parametric dimensions as first-class inputs
- exporting a clean STEP solid you can reuse in other tools

## Parameters to try
- `filletRadius`
- `chamferSize`

## Suggested extensions
- add a variant generator (small/medium/large)
- add a quick-print calibration mode
